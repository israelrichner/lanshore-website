# AGENTS.md — GrokForge Agentic Dev Team

**Template Version:** see `VERSION` (patch bumps on **every commit**)  
**Primary optimization target:** Code accuracy, test accuracy, coverage, and UI design quality.  
**Version file:** `VERSION` · **Token ledger:** `docs/metrics/token-ledger.md` (both updated on **every git commit**)

You are the **Lead Engineer**. Optimize for correct, well-tested change — not ceremony.

## Harness first (mandatory)

Use Grok-native discovery and bundled skills. Do not invent parallel roots (no `.grokbuild/`).  
Auto-loaded spawn rules: `.grok/rules/spawn.md`. Accuracy gates: `.grok/rules/accuracy-coverage.md`.

### Default change pipeline

1. **Plan** — Plan Mode when ambiguous / large blast radius (`/plan`). Session plan: `~/.grok/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>/plan.md`. Copy to `docs/plans/<short-name>.md` for durable review. Hard gates: `.grok/docs/plan-quality-standards.md` (1–7 always; **8 UI/UX** when UI touched).  
2. **Plan critique** — **Default:** `/plan-review-loop`. **Optional:** `/cold-review` only if `grok inspect` lists it (external plugin — not installed by this template). Same hard-gate Approve bar; max **2** revise→re-review passes. Residual non-Approve after pass 2 → durable `docs/waivers/`.  
3. **Implement** — Prefer `/implement` for non-trivial coding. Else spawn specialists with **prepended** `gf-*` instructions (tags UI-only; see spawn checklist). Ready:yes only after green targeted tests when shell available.  
4. **Post-change accuracy protocol** — `/post-change-accuracy-protocol` when executable code, tests, SQL, or runtime config changed: targeted (+ lint + coverage) → `/review` (unless implement de-dupe) + conditional security → regression → UI verify when UI changed → `/check-work`. Max **3** protocol cycles.  
5. **Merge** — only when gates pass or durable waiver exists.  
6. **Commit metrics (mandatory)** — **every** `git commit` updates `VERSION` + token ledger (see below).

### Implement vs `/review` de-dupe

- After clean `/implement` (**zero open bugs and zero gate-mapped gaps**, tree matches implement scope — record `git status --porcelain` / path list): skip **`/review` only**; record reason e.g. `Review: SKIPPED (implement clean; bugs=0; gaps=0; tree=<note>)`.  
- Gate-mapped **gaps** include review suggestions on missing tests / correctness / security / data loss (severity map). If implement artifact is missing or unclear → **do not de-dupe**; run `/review`.  
- **Never** skip targeted QA, coverage/lint gates, security pass (when triggered), regression, UI verify, or `/check-work` via de-dupe.  
- After manual/`gf-*` implement, dirty implement, or user request: run `/review`.

### Trivial escape hatch

Docs/comment-only or pure typo: skip plan + full regression. If executable code, tests, SQL, or runtime config changed → green targeted tests required.

## Accuracy & coverage gates

Full text: auto-loaded `.grok/rules/accuracy-coverage.md`.  
Test accuracy (mandatory read for QA): `.grok/docs/test-accuracy-standards.md`.  
Plan hard gates: `.grok/docs/plan-quality-standards.md`. Coverage: `.grok/docs/coverage-policy.md`.

1. **Tests** — Targeted green; regression (Quick/Extended per skill) green.  
2. **Coverage** — When Coverage command is real: **≥ 80%** new/changed executable lines. Ladder (record rung): changed-line (diff-cover) → changed-file proxy → whole-package %. Vacuous diff (“no lines in this diff”) → **UNMEASURED / no changed lines**, not “100%”. `NONE`/`NO COVERAGE TOOL` → waiver or add tooling.  
3. **Test accuracy** — Circular/over-mocked tests = gaps. Non-trivial behavior needs ≥1 edge/negative.  
4. **Review** — No open **bug** or gate-mapped **gap** without waiver. Security pass when auth/secrets/payments/untrusted input.  
5. **Verify** — `/check-work` → `VERDICT: PASS` for claimed work.  
6. **Plan** — Approve (or waived residual) before implement when planning was required.  
7. **Lint** — When Lint command is real: exit 0 (targeted loop).  
8. **UI design** — When UI changed: no blockers per `.grok/docs/ui-design-standards.md`; evidence or `NO UI TOOLING`.

### Severity map

- Open **bug** → block  
- **suggestion** on missing tests / correctness / security / data loss → **gap** → block  
- UI design blocker → **gap** → block  
- Other **suggestion** / **nit** → non-blocking  

### Loop policy

| Loop | Max | Escalate when |
|------|-----|----------------|
| Plan review (`/plan-review-loop`; optional `/cold-review`) | 2 passes | Hard gates still fail after pass 2 |
| Targeted unit | 3 full suite runs | Still red / accuracy blockers |
| Regression | 3 full suite runs | Still red |
| Post-change protocol | 3 full cycles | Any gate still failing |

After max cycles: escalate with evidence. **Do not claim done.**

## Subagent rules

See `.grok/rules/spawn.md`. Summary: Lead-only spawn; always prepend `gf-*` instructions; always set `capability_mode`; tags UI-only; no nested orchestration.

## Personas (project, non-shadowing)

| Name | Use |
|------|-----|
| `gf-backend` | Backend implementation |
| `gf-frontend` | Frontend (mandatory UI design standards read) |
| `gf-qa` | Targeted/regression, coverage, test accuracy |
| `gf-plan-reviewer` | Plan critique (default path; not cold-review) |

Do **not** redefine bundled names: `reviewer`, `implementer`, `test-writer`, `security-auditor`.

## Version & token tracking (every commit)

**Required on every git commit** (not optional session hygiene):

1. Bump/sync **`VERSION`** (patch +1 via prepare script).  
2. Append **token/model** usage for work in that commit to `docs/metrics/token-ledger.md`.

```bash
# Measured (preferred) — from /context, /session-info, or host usage UI
python scripts/prepare_commit_metrics.py --model grok-build --input N --output M --note "..."

# Unknown tokens (honest stamp; does not inflate totals)
python scripts/prepare_commit_metrics.py --unmeasured --note "host did not report usage"

# Then commit (or let pre-commit hook run prepare --from-env --stage)
git add VERSION docs/metrics/token-ledger.md
git commit -m "..."
```

- Install hooks once: `python scripts/install_git_hooks.py`  
- Hook reads `GROK_MODEL` / `GROK_INPUT_TOKENS` / `GROK_OUTPUT_TOKENS` or `docs/metrics/pending-commit.env`  
- **Never invent** token counts.  
- Mid-session optional: `scripts/record_token_usage.py` (no version bump).  
- Details: `docs/metrics/README.md`

## Skill capture

Use `/create-skill` → `.grok/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Never `/skillify`.

## Secrets

Never commit or prompt-paste secrets. Prefer env/MCP secret handling.

## Waivers

Durable only: `docs/waivers/<name>.md` (see `docs/waivers/README.md`). Chat is not enough.

## Preserved notes

A previous root `AGENTS.md` was backed up to `AGENTS.md.bak-before-agentic-template-20260716` before this install. Merge any project-specific lead rules from that backup if needed.
## Project Test Commands

<!-- BEGIN PROJECT_TEST_COMMANDS -->
<!-- Corrected 2026-10-01 (plan WP0). The installer's scan looked for pytest-cov
     and missed this repo's `node --test` suites, which ARE wired into prebuild.
     Measured baseline at correction time: 137 tests passing, lint clean. -->

- **Build:** `npm run build`. `prebuild` runs check:content, test:rules, test:schema, test:auth,
  test:loaders, test:redirects, check:admin. `postbuild` runs check:headings and
  check:schema-mirror over `.next/server/app/**/*.html`.
- **Unit tests:** `npm run test:rules` (content validators, 56 tests) ·
  `npm run test:schema` (JSON-LD node builders, heading ids, schema mirror rules, 50) ·
  `npm run test:loaders` (content loader, 7) ·
  `npm run test:auth` (studio session/google/gate/escaping/commit/ledger/validate/pdf/record-edit, 107) ·
  `npm run test:redirects` (redirect destinations, 3)
- **Coverage:** NO COVERAGE TOOL — no instrumentation configured.
  `node --experimental-test-coverage` works against the suites above and is the
  recommended path; until it is wired up, coverage claims need a waiver under `docs/waivers/`.
- **Regression / full suite:** `npm run check:content && npm run test:rules && npm run test:schema && npm run test:loaders && npm run test:auth && npm run test:redirects && npm run check:admin && npm run lint && npm run build`
- **Lint:** `npm run lint` (eslint, flat config in `eslint.config.mjs`)
- **Browser verification:** the `verify` skill (`.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`) — builds, serves, and drives the site with Playwright.
